  {
    question: 'Why does construction accounting require specialized expertise?',
    answer: 'Construction accounting involves unique elements like project-based costing, work-in-progress accounting, retainage tracking, and variable billing cycles that general accounting firms may not handle well. A construction-focused accountant (like QuantiFi) is familiar with industry specifics: for example, we know how to properly account for change orders, handle retention on invoices, choose the right revenue recognition method for long-term projects, and ensure job costs are allocated accurately. This specialized expertise means your financial reports truly reflect your project performance and you avoid costly mistakes (like overbilling or compliance violations) that can happen when using a generic bookkeeper.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does QuantiFi handle job costing and WIP reporting for my construction projects?',
    answer: 'We set up your accounting system to track costs by job and phase, so every dollar spent is assigned to the right project and category. Throughout each project, we provide detailed Job Cost Reports comparing actual expenses to your budget, helping you spot overruns early. We also prepare Work-in-Progress (WIP) reports that show each project\'s percentage complete, revenue earned vs. billed, and the status of under-billings or over-billings. These WIP reports are typically updated monthly and are invaluable for both internal management and external stakeholders (like bonding companies). In short, QuantiFi ensures you always know how each job is performing financially, in real time. (For deeper insights on managing job profitability, check out our blog post on job cost control in construction.)'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you assist with construction payroll and certified payroll reports?',
    answer: 'Yes, we provide comprehensive construction payroll services that help contractors, subcontractors, and construction companies manage payroll efficiently and stay fully compliant. Our team supports your payroll process within your in-house system, whether it\'s Gusto, QuickBooks, ADP, or Paychex, ensuring accurate setup, reporting, and reconciliation every pay cycle. While we do not calculate or file payroll taxes, we manage every aspect of payroll data entry, certified payroll reporting, and construction payroll compliance documentation to keep your books accurate and audit-ready. We prepare and maintain certified payroll reports, including WH-347 forms, for government-funded construction projects, ensuring full compliance with prevailing wage laws and Davis-Bacon Act requirements. For companies employing union workers or multi-state crews, our experts handle varying wage rates, fringe benefits, and deductions with precision. We also produce job-costed labor reports, workers\' compensation summaries, and certified payroll submissions that meet federal, state, and local standards. QuantiFi\'s construction payroll reporting services simplify complex payroll requirements, reduce compliance risks, and save valuable administrative time. With accurate reporting, timely submissions, and full visibility into labor costs, we help construction firms run payroll seamlessly so you can focus on building projects while we handle the numbers behind them.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will you work with our existing accounting software and project management tools?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. QuantiFi can work with whatever systems you currently use. We have experience with all major construction accounting software, including QuickBooks, Sage 100/300 Contractor, Foundation software, and more, as well as project management platforms like Procore, PlanGrid, or Buildertrend, Contractor Foreman. Our team will adapt to your workflow or help you improve it by integrating your systems. For example, we can sync your project management tool with your accounting ledger to automatically import field data (timesheets, expenses) into your books. If you\'re not satisfied with your current setup, we\'ll recommend and implement better solutions. In any case, you won\'t have to "start from scratch"; we leverage your existing tech and make sure you get the most out of it.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will QuantiFi help with bonding and preparing financials for surety companies?',
    answer: 'Yes, we routinely assist clients with bonding requirements. We\'ll prepare the specialized financial statements that surety companies and lenders often request. This includes producing an accurate work-in-progress schedule, detailed contract backlog reports, and adjusting financials to meet surety format standards. We understand the key financial ratios (like working capital, debt-to-equity, etc.) that underwriters evaluate, and we\'ll advise you on presenting your financials in the best light. Additionally, we can coordinate directly with your bond agent or underwriter if questions arise, providing any supplemental data they need. With QuantiFi\'s help, you can approach bond applications confidently, knowing your financial documents are in order to maximize your bonding capacity.'
